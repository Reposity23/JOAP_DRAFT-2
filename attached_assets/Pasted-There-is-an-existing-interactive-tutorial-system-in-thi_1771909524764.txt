There is an existing interactive tutorial system in this project that needs to be overhauled. Read task.txt in the project root — it contains the full specification. Also search the codebase for comments containing "TUTORIAL OVERHAUL" and "ALIVE CURSOR" for inline guidance.
Summary of what you need to do:
Replace Gemini TTS with local MP3 files. The tutorial currently calls POST /api/voice-insight (Google Gemini TTS API) for each step's narration. Replace this with pre-recorded MP3 files located in the /tutorial_mp3/ folder, named tut1.mp3 through tut17.mp3. Add a backend route GET /api/tutorial-audio/:filename to serve them (see commented-out implementation in server/routes.ts). Update the playStep() function in client/src/components/tutorial.tsx to load audio from these local files instead of the API.
Implement an "alive cursor" choreography system. Each tutorial step has a set of timed actions (move cursor, click buttons, type text, hover elements, switch tabs, open/close dialogs) that should execute in sync with the MP3 narration. Add a CursorAction interface and an actions array to each step. The cursor should smoothly animate between elements, simulate clicks and typing, and feel like a real person is demonstrating the system. Every step in ADMIN_STEPS has detailed choreography comments explaining exactly what the cursor should do and when.
Settings preview (tut14): During the Settings tutorial step, the cursor should pick a random color theme and gradient, apply it as a visual preview, but revert all settings changes when the tutorial completes. Save original settings before the step, restore them in onComplete.
Page transitions: When moving between tutorial steps on different pages, the cursor should first move to the sidebar, hover and click the next page's nav link, then start the new step — not just teleport.
All actions must be non-destructive — no real data created/modified/deleted. Clear typed text, close opened dialogs, and revert visual changes when each step ends.
The main files to modify are client/src/components/tutorial.tsx, client/src/App.tsx, and server/routes.ts. All three have inline comments marked "TUTORIAL OVERHAUL" guiding you. The task.txt file has the complete CursorAction interface spec, timing approach, and per-step choreography summary.

make sure you  testing them by doing tutorials, make sure its on time, focus on time, pointers on time etc.

also in reports, make the chart look the same in the dashboard chart so overhaul the chart in the "reports" page.
you can check that i already uploaded all the mp3's
